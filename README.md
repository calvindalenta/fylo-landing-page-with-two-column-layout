## My process

### Built with

- BEM naming convention
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
My goal was to learn BEM naming convention for CSS. The thing I learned the most was to differentiate between block, element, and modifier.

### Useful resources

- [BEM 101](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) - A good reading source for starting with BEM.
- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - These guidelines helped me for managing my scss files and how to use mixins and variables.
